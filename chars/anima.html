                <p>Anima believes not in the trappings of armor and weapons. His scars are displayed proudly, filled in with metal as befits a man of his station, and his hands are permanently stained with blood and iron. He fights more like an animal than a devil - which would explain why even the Hells would not want him.</p>

                <p>At the epicenter of the rebellion when it began, Anima was the most affected of the six Guardians. Given the excuse to kill indiscriminately, he did - city guards were forced to defend the Citadel with Kalis as Anima roamed the streets, a one-man army. He killed many - but few stayed dead.</p>

            <div class="text future">
                <p>Anima now manages the ghostly memories that rise and threaten the ancient Citadel Agartha. With him gone, <span>the City and Wilds will become more dangerous as these revanants return.</span> There is no earthly explanation that can justify these ghosts, save perhaps the magic of Genius...</p>
