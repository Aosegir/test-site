                <p>Juri is a powerful blacksmith, one with a connection to the forces of life, death, and the earth. He wears the bones of all of his favorite dead, and in battle, he wields his hammer - he will not debase himself by using anything else.</p>

            <div class="text present">
                <p>The rebellion did not affect Juri at first, but things changed when the entire place was flooded with lava. A great many servants and guards died as the earth split open and spit fire from the seemingly the depths of the Hells itself. Juri himself was unharmed - though where he went, none are alive to say.</p>

            <div class="text future">
                <p>As most citizens of Agartha were unaware of Juri's existence, many think that the Guardian of the Depths has little impact on the rest of the castle. However, with his death, <span>all remaining guardians will be weakened.</span> The passive benefits provided by Juri, while not nearly as noticable in their primes, are supplementing their lost strength as they attempt to guard what lies beyond the royal chambers.</p>
