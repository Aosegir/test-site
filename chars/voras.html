                <p>Voras the Gold is a metallic dragon, the evil counterparts to the elemental chromatic dragons. Second only to their dark queen, the Platinum Dragon, gold dragons represent the sin of pride above all. Voras demands worship, tribute, and is immune to fire.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="text present">
                <p>While the guardians below fought against a rebellion, Voras fought something else - though no one knows what. Though all think her having died or fled, she remains within the highest point of the Tower, badly wounded and one wing destroyed from her fight. She cannot eat or drink - there is nothing to sustain her, and her pride forbids her from being seen in such a wounded state. But neither can she die, for she guards the light that keeps Agartha lit, and Enna's worship keeps her useful to the Mother of Haven - and so she remains alive.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="text future">
                <p>With Voras dead, the lights of Agartha will go out. It will become more difficult to see and navigate, but <span>Enna will become greatly weakened</span>, her fractured mind unable to maintain its sanity as the sun goes dark.</p>
