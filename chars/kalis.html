                <p>Kalis was one of the most renowned fighters of a bygone era. Proficient in all common weapons and quite a few exotic ones, his primary weapon is the sword, the only weapon of a true knight.</p>

            <div class="text present">
                <p>In the attack on Agartha, Kalis was grievously wounded defending the door to the royal chambers, though he eventually hunted down all the rebels in the castle. Now, he stalks the halls of the Citadel, ensuring that he does his duty and protects what he has been charged with, even though his god has abandoned him.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="text future">
                <p>Kalis' mere presence in the Citadel maintains what little order is still left among those loyal to the Great Devourers. With him dead, <span>random encounters will no longer be weighted.</span> This means that the party is as likely to face a deadly encounter as they are a weak one. Those blessed by fortune may consider this a great boon, and seek out Kalis' demise before all others - but one false step will find unwary adventurers in the clutches of things best left unseen...</p>
