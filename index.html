                    <p>Kalis was a soldier in a foregone era, a man of such skill that he was given impossible tasks to accomplish simply because those in power wished to see if he could. The more battles he won, the more his wounds mounted - but he noticed that those who tended to his wounds improved upon his body, blessing him with strange ferro-archine prostheses. He did not notice that these were the result of the Emperor of Steel until those around him deemed him a monster fit only for death. After that, he had a new master, and carried out his mission as he did all his others - with more skill than any other.</p>

                    <p>War is no place for the weak. Most would do anything to survive - betray an ally, flee a battle, surrender to a superior foe. Anima had never needed to do the first, for all died too quickly. He never had to do the second, because he craved victory and death in equal measure. He never did the third, until the Emperor took notice of him. The first emissary the Emperor sent to recruit Anima was killed - so was the second, and the third. It was only to General Belakastro that Animus was forced to kneel and become assimilated in the Emperor's forces.</p>

                    <p>There is no race that worships the sun like the Alraune - and there was never an Alraune that worshipped the sun as much as Enna. She spoke to the sun, and the sun spoke back; while none beileved her capable of such a relationship, she proved them wrong. She asked for proof of her devotion, and it kissed her brow, causing her hair and eyes to bloom the amber color of its light. When a harsh winter overtook their lands and the sun vanished from the sky, the other Alraune turned to her. She would be their savior - but as she gifted them with the Mother of Haven's light, she learned that she had turned them into slaves.</p>

                    <p>There are few creatures more easily appealed to vanity than dragons. Their desire for authority and worship is rivalled only by their greed. While the events of his upbringing are unknown, for Voras, this obsession common among his kind reached untold heights. The only soul in Agartha to actively seek out the blessing of one of the Great Devourers, it was easy for the Mother of Haven to grant him a place where he would be worshipped above all - just as she wishes for.</p>

                    <p>There is little more interesting to mortals than the study of life and death. Understanding of disease, anatomy, and the nature of the soul are foremost among any topics discussed at institutions of higher learning. But there are some who remain unsatisfied with even the rigorous academia compiled by centuries of discovery, and they seek to make breakthroughs of their own. Of course, the easiest way to understand death is to witness it directly - by causing it, for example. Genius was obsessed with preserving his own life, and would go to any lengths to do so. By the time he became a lich, he was more than willing to continue the work of the Blessed of Night.</p>

                    <p>A blackmsith by trade, Juri was content to let the fighting be done by other members of his family and clan. When they fell in battle, however, those who survived brought back the fallen's bones and weapons to him, insisting they be remembered. When he began experiencing visions of the lives of the deceased, he thought nothing of it. The more he worked, the less of himself remained - until one day, he heard a voice. An unknown individual asking for his expertise in the matter he was most familiar with - bones, weapons, and death. The Blessed of Night barely needed to do any convincing.</p>
